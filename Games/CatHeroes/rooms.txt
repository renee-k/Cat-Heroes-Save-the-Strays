Outside building
You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.  A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully to the south.  A road runs up a small hill to the west. On a sign, you see a riddle: “I’m the path to heaven, not the road to the core, I’m not where the sun rises, nor where you explore. I’m not the way to the pole, where cold winds blow, So tell me, traveler, which way do you go?”

Introduction to level 2
Hey, adventurer! I'm a programmer and have temporarily adopted a stray kitty called Daisy, but I'm so busy with my job that I just don't have the time to take care of her. It would be really great if you could adopt and take care of her! I'm going to give you some little challenges, though. I've created an interesting "secret house" for you, and if you answer all the questions correctly, you'll be able to go through the rooms and finally get to own this cute little kitten! Do you want to give it a try? (Choose A/B plz~) By the way, you can take this U disk near the door. You can use it to skip one question by entering "SKIP" (then you will lose the U disk)!
A: YES!
B: No, thanks.

Mysterious Hallway
You decide to walk up some stairs and are now inside a hallway with two rooms. To the left of you is a bathroom and above you is a ladder that leads elsewhere. You weirdly hear the meows of another cat and a lot of music coming from the room across the hallway. There seems to be more mysteries in this secret house, but maybe you can find something useful in the other rooms before seeking the truth?

Type in the music note letters (C, D, E, F, G, A, or B) until all notes of the song have been played. Note that if you play the wrong note, you will scare the cat and lose progress! Type PLAY to begin playing the piano.

Oh no! I, the deranged lady, have locked you in my basement. Don't worry, to get out, all you have to do is unlock that door! To navigate the rooms, look at the blue arrows (left, right, up down) or type picture to see the picture.
You can also type commands (except for the locked door). Once you've collected all the objects, go to the padlock and type hint for a very special answer. Good luck escaping my lovely basement (you won't)!
